Thesis topic: Simulation of intelligent behavior of Non-Player Characters in First-Person Shooter computer game environment using Machine Learning techniques.

There are two main objectives of the practical part of this thesis:

1.	Design and develop Quake II bot that is able to compete with human players and other third-party bots.
2.	Apply on-line reinforcement learning methods to chosen botâ€™s decision problem.

The first one will allow us to test in practice basic methods of First-Person Shooter AI programming and will provide a base for further development.

Completing the second objective will let us evaluate suitability of on-line reinforcement learning in this application as well as its implementing and testing complexity, which is especially interesting  for commercial game developers.

Whether a bot is able to compete with human players and third-party bots will be verified with an experiment  under conditions similar to a typical Quake II match.
